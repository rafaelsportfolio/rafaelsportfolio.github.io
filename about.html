                Hi! My Name is Rafael and I am a self taught photographer.
                I do photography for the creativity, looking at subjects,
                coming up with a story, or maybe show a reflection of myself
                through the lense of my camera. Growing up, I've always had
                some trouble connecting with people around me. I have found
                that for me, capturing photos can do some of the talking,
                knowing that people look at my pictures helps me feel connected
                in some odd way. A sense of familiarity and nostalgia, a space 
                of calm and peace is what I strive for when taking pictures. It's
                my passion, showing people the art in what they see in their 
                everyday lives.
